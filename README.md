## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a systems programmer focused on building high-performance, reliable software using Rust and C++. This space is dedicated to my personal projects, experiments, and ongoing efforts to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with low-level, performance-critical code.

My primary areas of interest lie in systems-level developmentâ€”where control over memory, concurrency, and hardware interaction plays a central role. I work with both Rust and C++ because they offer unique strengths: C++ for its deep legacy in systems programming and unmatched control, and Rust for its modern safety guarantees and zero-cost abstractions. Together, they provide a powerful foundation for writing robust, efficient, and maintainable code.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a variety of projects that reflect my focus on performance, correctness, and design. These include everything from lightweight operating system components and networking tools to data structures and concurrency primitives. I often experiment with concepts like multithreading, memory management, and compile-time optimization to deepen my understanding and sharpen my skills.

Code quality, documentation, and clarity are important to me. I aim to make each project approachableâ€”whether you're here to explore, learn, or contribute. Where applicable, I include benchmarks, build instructions, and detailed READMEs to ensure others can follow along and replicate results.

This repository is a reflection of my passion for systems programming and my commitment to continuous learning. If youâ€™re a fellow low-level developer, a Rust or C++ enthusiast, or simply curious about systems programming, feel free to browse, fork, or collaborate.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and letâ€™s keep building software thatâ€™s fast, safe, and built to last.
